If you have any issues with your Crutchfield product, contact this website's Customer Service department and they will be able to provide your Crutchfield order number. Good things come in small packages:    Our customers have been using Polk Audio's RC55i in-wall speakers for movies and music for years - and their glowing reviews are telling. These compact speakers provide clear, accurate sound, and are an ideal choice for small- to medium-sized rooms. Want to make them totally disappear? Paintable grilles let you easily match them to your decor.     Versatile entertainment options:    The value-packed RC55is work great as the left and right front or surround channels of an in-wall home theater. You can also use a pair of these with your favorite amp for a music system with minimum visual clutter. Team them up with a  powered subwoofer  for a rockin' 2.1 system.      DIY installation :    Here's a tip I learned when installing my Polk in-wall speakers. If you're placing the RC55is six feet or higher on your wall, turn them upside down so that the tweeter is at the bottom. Then, aim the tweeter towards your seat. You'll get better high-frequency detail since the tweeter is closer to ear level.      If this is a do-it-yourself installation, check out our  guide to installing in-ceiling speakers , along with our selection of  in-wall speaker wire . Optional  pre-construction brackets  are recommended for new construction. Free lifetime technical support is provided with every Crutchfield purchase.

If you have any issues with your Crutchfield product, contact this website's Customer Service department and they will be able to provide your Crutchfield order number. A turntable with convenient connections and easy operation: Dust off those vinyl records and put them back into your listening rotation with the DP-29F turntable from Denon. Even if your receiver or amp does not have a phono input, this versatile turntable will play through your system - you don't even need a phono adapter. The DP-29F includes a built-in phono preamp, so you can hook it up to your system through a standard analog connection. But if your receiver  does  have a phono input, and you'd prefer to use it, a small switch beneath the platter disengages the preamp.  The DP-29F features an automatic system that starts the music with a simple touch of a button. When the record is finished, the tonearm automatically returns to its original position. By eliminating the need to handle the tonearm manually, you dramatically minimize the chances of inadvertently scratching your records. There's also a manual lifter mechanism that allows you to place the needle on the record wherever you want, just in case you'd like to skip to a song in the middle of a side. And for solid, dependable playback, the DP-29F has been precision manufactured with rigid diecast aluminum for perfectly stable turntable rotation. What's in the Box: 1.

If you have any issues with your Crutchfield product, contact this website's Customer Service department and they will be able to provide your Crutchfield order number. Get stereo sound from a single speaker: Looking to add music in tight spaces as part of your custom-installed home audio system? The RC6s in-ceiling speaker from Polk Audio delivers both channels of a stereo signal from a single overhead location. It's perfect for a bathroom, kitchen, hallway, or anywhere else that you want great stereo sound from just one hideaway speaker.    Polk's dual-tweeter design reproduces both the left and right channels of your stereo music sources with a single speaker.   It's also great for big rooms: Want to jam to music in a big living room or bedroom? Place an RC6s in each corner and get stereo sound no matter where you are.  Its clever design gives you the full song without worrying about being too close to one speaker, and too far from another. That way you aren't hearing the guitar and vocals from the left speaker, and bass and drums from the right.   Get all of the musical detail: Polk knows how important it is to preserve the high-frequency detail in your favorite recordings. So they've equipped the RC6s with two soft dome tweeters for crisp, clear sound.  They're paired with a robust 6-1/2\" dual-voice coil woofer that takes care of mids and lows. On the back of the speaker you'll find separate connections for the left and right channels of your amplifier.   DIY installation: Polk's rotating-cam design makes your in-ceiling installation go smoother. Once you have the RC6s in place, simply use a screwdriver to tighten each cam for a secure grip against the back of the ceiling.  If this is a do-it-yourself installation, check out our  guide to installing in-ceiling speakers , along with our selection of  in-wall speaker wire . An optional  pre-construction bracket  is recommended for new construction. Free lifetime technical support is provided with every Crutchfield purchase.

To take advantage of this unique service, a Crutchfield order number is needed.  If you have any issues with your Crutchfield product, contact this website's Customer Service department and they will be able to provide your Crutchfield order number. Onkyo's DX-C390 offers an unbeatable combination of audiophile construction, playback versatility, and great convenience features. With exclusive Onkyo technologies like the AccuPulse Quartz System and Vector Linear Shaping Circuitry, the 'C390 virtually eliminates vibration-induced jitter and stray pulse noise. The ear-pleasing result is better stereo imaging, tighter bass, and cleaner sound from all your CDs. The brushed aluminum front panel and anti-resonant chassis serve as further assurance of rock-solid performance.  The 'C390 not only plays regular CDs, but also your home-burned CD-Rs and CD-RWs, and even long-playing MP3 discs. This changer also sports a unique 6-disc carousel design that lets you change five discs while the sixth keeps playing. Next Selection lets you \"cue up\" the next song you want to hear without interrupting the song that's currently playing. And the remote gives you easy control of your music from across the room - its direct disc and track access lets you quickly locate exactly the track you want to hear.
